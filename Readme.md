# 🌟 JavaScript Design Patterns 🌟

## 📜 Historical background on why I'm doing this
---
Four years ago, I created this repository to learn about design patterns ([link](https://github.com/massoudsalem/DesignPatterns)). Now, I want to do the same thing for JavaScript.

But why JavaScript and not TypeScript? One of my college friends stated that "creating design patterns in JS is very difficult because JS is not a hardcore OOP language." However, I decided to create this repository in JavaScript after finding this book on [patterns.dev](https://patterns.dev/).

## 🤔 What are design patterns?
---
Before answering this question, let's take a step back and ask, "What is engineering about?" Engineering is like a game of Lego. You have a lot of pieces, and you have to build something with them. But how do you do this? You have to understand how to use each piece and how to combine them to build something useful.

Design patterns are like Lego pieces. They represent the best practices for using programming languages and offer solutions for common problems that we face in software engineering.

### ❓ What is the difference between design patterns and algorithms?
Design patterns are focused on how to structure your code, while algorithms are focused on how to solve a problem.

Design patterns provide the "how?", algorithms provide the "what?".
